  <h2 class="mb-2" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Overview</h2>
  <p class="mt-2">My research lies at the intersection of neuroscience, signal processing, and clinical care. I study how brain activity reflects perception, emotion, and cognition— especially in people whose minds are harder to access: patients with depression, disorders of consciousness, or autism.</p>
  <p>What drives me is curiosity. I see each study as both a scientific challenge and a creative journey—designing new paradigms, building tools, and trying to consider issues from a different perspective.</p>
  <p>My analyses combine rigorous EEG signal processing with advanced computational tools such as machine learning, genetic algorithms, and reverse correlation. I enjoy the collaborative puzzle-solving that happens at the interface between neuroscience, computer science, and mathematics.</p>
  <p>But research isn’t just data. During EEG experiments, whether with healthy volunteers or hospitalized patients, I see research as a space for meaningful encounters. Preparing high-resolution EEGs often takes time, and I value the conversations and human diversity this allows. Clinical settings, on the other hand, offer a rare window into medical practice: how clinicians think, how care is delivered, and what gaps science can help bridge. These moments are sometimes hard, but always meaningful. They remind me why science must stay human.</p>
  <p>I also believe neuroscience shouldn't exist in a vacuum. I often expand my interpretative framework by drawing insights from psychology, psychiatry, anthropology, and even ethnology. I believe that to understand what makes people feel, suffer, or heal, we must consider their socio-cultural ecosystem. This cross-disciplinary mindset fuels my commitment to collaborative science and epistemological openness.</p>

      <h4>EEG Signal Analysis</h4>
    </div>
    <p>Diagnostic challenges are common in medicine, particularly in neurology and psychiatry, where doctors often lack physiological biomarkers to characterize specific diseases (e.g., depression, coma, neurodegenerative syndromes), especially in their early stages.</p>
    <p>I started working with EEG during my master’s program because of its clinical applicability: it allows me to work with both healthy people and patients (Alzheimer's, coma...) without the constraints of fMRI or invasive recordings, and its millisecond temporal precision allows me to investigate time-sensitive processes. </p>
    <p>Throughout my research, I have pursued two key goals:
        <ul>
          <li>To design innovative techniques for extracting meaningful information from electrophysiological data,</li>
          <li>To enhance or build new diagnostic and prognostic protocols for neuropsychiatric disorders.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>On a technical level I was thoroughly trained across the whole workflow: from manual preprocessing and visual inspection with GUI tools to fully automated, reproducible pipelines. I learned MATLAB and Python by myself and coded plugins and algorithms that turned expert, time-consuming tasks into automated routines.</p>
    <p>Today my strengths are at the crossroads of neuroscience and signal processing: I tailor pipelines based on experiment protocol and patient type, port tools towards Python with an open-science mindset, and integrate individualized analyses and machine-learning methods for clinically meaningful results. My strategy is based on logic and practicality: first, selecting approaches based on the specific questions requiring answers, followed by examinig data through hands-on techniques, and finally, building automation and replicability suitable for actual clinical application.</p>

      <h4>Music, Memory & Emotion</h4>
    </div>
    <p>I started from being a musician, and the question “why does music light up our minds?” is what drove me into neuroscience. This led me to the Rihanna project, the first I worked on, where we explored how musical memory, which recruits distributed cortical networks, can remain remarkably preserved in neurodegenerative conditions where hippocampus-dependent autobiographical memory fails. The primary goal was clinical: to understand whether music-based mechanisms could help distinguish Alzheimer’s from depression in older adults, so that care could be better targeted.
    My work focused on the fact that musical stimuli are not neutral: emotional valence, familiarity and liking shape what we remember from music, and physiological responses.</p>

    <p>I collaborated on experiments on musical frisson, and helped coordinate an ambitious multimodal recording (EEG synchronized with cardiac and electrodermal measures) on a cohort recorded during a live conductors’ competition. Because I’m a trained classical musician, I contributed to stimulus selection, protocol design and the operational logistics (many hands-on sessions, simultaneous participant management).</p>

      <h4>Machine Learning for EEG</h4>
    </div>
    <p>I began using machine learning on EEG within the Impresario context, a long-term effort that paired new sensing hardware (including work on photonic reservoir computing and nano-optic sensors) with algorithmic advances. I saw ML as the natural way to extract weak, high-level cognitive signals that traditional averaging misses and to move EEG from group-level science toward individualized, clinically useful diagnostics. I learned fast and mostly by doing: a steep self-training curve in programming and ML was required to turn the ambition of the project into a functional pipeline early in my PhD.</p>
    <p>On the technical side I worked across the whole stack. I hand-designed and tested many features, then benchmarked classical supervised classifiers (k-NN, SVM-style approaches), unsupervised methods (hierarchical clustering), and reservoir approaches such as echo-state networks — later extending into photonic reservoir computing when hardware allowed. I also experimented with deep learning on raw traces but kept a critical eye on opacity: I paired modelling with explainable-AI methods (reverse-correlation / probing) so I could check what the models actually relied on and potentially discover interpretable biomarkers. Practically, I scripted end-to-end pipelines (MATLAB and Python), ran benchmarks, and learned how to port and document steps for reproducibility and deployment.</p>
    <p>That work gave me a pragmatic, sceptical stance: EEG is low-SNR and full of electrical and biological artifacts, so sloppy ML produces beautiful but useless results. To counter that I led a large literature synthesis and produced methodology guidelines addressing common pitfalls; I’ve published and advocated for clear documentation, careful benchmarking, and explainability. My focus now is on combining rigorous preprocessing, sensible feature choices, explainable models and reproducible pipelines so EEG+ML can move from trendy claims to reliable clinical tools.</p>

      <h4>Disorders of Consciousness</h4>
    </div>
    <p>I encountered disorders of consciousness during my PhD because a rich, under-exploited clinical dataset was available and a machine-learning collaboration with a mathematics lab gave me the tools to interrogate it. I worked with an N400 semantic paradigm — moving from simple auditory detection (can the brain hear the beep?) to discrimination and finally to semantic integration — to ask whether residual language processing could be detected in patients who otherwise appear unconscious. That methodological thread pulled me into coma work: if hidden cognitive responses exist, careful paradigms and the right analyses can reveal them.</p>
<p>I did this work at the bedside as well as in the lab. I accompanied clinicians to hospitals, ran EEG recordings on patients in intensive care, and learned the practical and human realities of working with critically ill people: consent is fraught, family decisions matter, and every interaction can affect interpretation. One concrete project was optimizing a patient’s own-name stimulus using synthesis and reverse-correlation to maximize elicited brain responses — a directly usable tool developed in close collaboration with neurologists at GHU Paris and Cochin. That translational, clinician-driven focus meant the outputs had to be implementable immediately, not just elegant on paper.</p>
<p>Methodologically I’m uncompromising: I’ve seen inflated accuracies and poor reproducibility in the literature, and I refuse to sell seductive but clinically useless claims to physicians. My priority is pragmatic, ethically responsible tools — clear metrics (sensitivity/specificity), documented pipelines, and interfaces that fit hospital workflows. At Sophysa I extended this mindset into neuro-monitoring for critical care: build what clinicians can use, validate what matters for prognosis, and always keep the patient-level stakes front and center.</p>

      <h4>Vocal Smiles & Autism</h4>
    </div>
    <p>I joined the project as part of a post-doctoral fellowship tied to the ANR Sepia partnership with the Autisme Center located in Tours (under Marie Gomot’s direction). My responsibility was to create and validate the stimulus and the behavioral protocol that the clinic would later use. We started with a fundamental inquiry: what underlies the difficulties experienced by autistic individuals when processing socio-emotional cues, for instance, the vocal manifestation of a smile? Does this stem from a difficulty specifically in emotion processing, a broader issue in how sensory information is encoded, a combination of the two, or perhaps another factor entirely? To address this, we framed the problem along three distinct phases: perception (can the signal be detected?), representation (what does a “smiling voice” look like in sensory space?) and action (what social response does it trigger, e.g. mimicry).</p>
    
    <p>Specifically, I designed a reverse-correlation paradigm using vocoids (e.g. /a/, a nasal vowel, and others spanning the vowel space) and generated hundreds of spectral variants for each phoneme. Participants’ task was to choose between pairs of variants which one had a more noticeable "smiling" quality. Based on their responses, we reconstructed the auditory features that define a « vocal smile » in typical listeners, and measured the internal noise that affects this perception. We tested effects of speaker and listener sex (male/female voices and male/female listeners) to understand how representations vary across those dimensions, and the outcome was a validated stimulus set ready for use with autistic subjects later on.</p>

    <p>Regarding the hands-on execution, I drafted the research procedure, oversaw all necessary ethical approval (IRB) and recruitment logistics, recorded base phonemes (my voice and a JJ’s), chose short validated scales for empathy, autism traits, and alexithymia suitable for online testing, supervised an intern, and implemented an online deployment in partnership with INSEAD using a tokenized server to restrict access. We successfully enrolled more than 200 individuals for the validation cohort, a significant undertaking for the development of such auditory materials.</p>

      <h4>Science & Industry</h4>
    </div>
    <p>At Sophysa I worked at the intersection of clinical practice and R&D as an Innovation Product Manager: my mission was to translate real clinical needs into viable neuro-monitoring products. I focused particularly on intracranial pressure measurement in traumatic brain injury, running the line between physicians who described problems and engineers who could propose solutions. I was the person who turned clinical anecdotes into concrete project proposals and asked the uncomfortable questions early — is this technically feasible, is it legally allowable, and can it realistically make money?</p>
<p>My day-to-day was brutally pragmatic: user research with doctors and nurses, iterative prototyping, repeated user tests, and constant dialogue with regulatory, R&D and finance. I wrote the conviction dossiers that went to the executive committee, estimated costs and market potential, and flagged technical or regulatory blockers. I also kept environmental and usability trade-offs on the table (reusable module + single-use interface, sterility constraints, scarce components), because “nice idea” without practicable design or supply-chain thinking is useless — and expensive.</p>
<p>What mattered most was deployment, not prestige. I insisted that designs fit existing clinical workflows, be interpretable by physicians under pressure, and be deployable in diverse contexts (big hospitals, field settings, low-resource regions). I refused to oversell performance or hide methodological weaknesses: when lives and budgets are at stake, transparency and clinical relevance beat sexy demos. In short — I bridged science and industry to deliver things clinicians can actually use, and I accepted the responsibility that comes with that.</p>
