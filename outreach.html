<!--Explanations text-->
<section class="research-intro">
  <p>For me, research is not only about producing knowledge but also about sharing it. Science outreach is essential: it connects complex discoveries with everyday life, builds trust in research, and gives people the tools to make informed decisions.</p>
  <p>I believe that communicating science clearly helps society as a whole—when people understand how the brain works, or how technologies like EEG and machine learning can be applied, they are more engaged and more empowered. Outreach is also an opportunity for scientists to grow. Explaining complex ideas in simple terms sharpens clarity, encourages creativity, and fosters humility. Each time I present my work to children, students, or the general public, I learn to see science through fresh eyes.</p>
  <p>It is especially important to engage children early. Sparking curiosity in a classroom or during a public workshop shows them that science is not distant or intimidating, but part of their world. Whether through interactive games, public talks, or radio interviews, I strive to make neuroscience accessible, relatable, and inspiring.</p>
  <p>Outreach also breaks the boundaries of the “ivory tower.” It opens a dialogue between scientists and society, ensuring research is not confined to the lab but shared as part of our collective culture. This exchange enriches both sides: the public gains knowledge and trust, while researchers like me gain confidence, communication skills, and a stronger sense of purpose.</p>
  <p>This page presents some of my outreach activities, from school workshops to public festivals and media appearances—each one a step toward making science a shared adventure.</p>

        <div class="event-text">
          <p>The Nuit Européenne des Chercheurs is a Europe-wide event where researchers meet the public through interactive demonstrations, live performances, and discussions, all on the same evening across more than 200 cities. In <a href="https://actu.umlp.fr/article/les-emotions-lepreuve-de-lordinateur-006683/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Besançon</a>, the event was held at the Musée du Temps, transforming the space into a lively hub of scientific discovery.</p>
          <p>I took part with the neuroscience team, presenting an interactive installation where visitors wore an EEG cap and watched their emotions appear on a screen in real time. Moving spheres shifted according to the participant’s emotional state—joy, anger, or sadness—making brain activity visible and tangible. Alongside this demonstration, I explained how EEG and machine learning can be combined to classify different types of brain activity, from concentration and relaxation to music perception and emotional processing, with potential applications in clinical diagnosis.</p>
          <p>That evening, I was also interviewed live on Radio Campus Besançon for a special broadcast. Using everyday analogies—like teaching a computer to tell apart cats and dogs—I described how machine learning can learn to distinguish subtle neural patterns, and how this could one day help doctors detect depression, Alzheimer’s disease, or support prognosis in coma patients. The live exchange allowed me to share both the playful side of neuroscience and its long-term medical impact.</p>
          <p>Finally, I emphasized the international dimension of my research. Although my thesis was based in Besançon, it relied on close collaboration with colleagues in Switzerland, Germany, and Spain, whose expertise in psychiatry, mathematics, and machine learning enriched the project. This European network embodied the spirit of the event itself: science as a collaborative endeavor, crossing borders to tackle complex questions together.</p>

        <div class="event-text">
          <p>The Nuit Européenne des Chercheurs is a pan-European evening dedicated to encounters between scientists and the public. In 2017, the <a href="https://actu.umlp.fr/article/le-champ-des-possibles-005226/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Besançon edition</a> was held at the former Faculty of Medicine, Place Saint-Jacques, where dozens of researchers offered interactive activities and demonstrations.</p>
          <p>I presented an installation developed with the neuroscience team that allowed the public to “paint with their brain.” Visitors equipped with an EEG cap could see their emotional states instantly translated into colors projected on a screen.</p>
          <p>This visualization linked inner states and visual expression, which made brain activity both visible and playful for the participants.</p>
          <p>This creative approach provided a direct way for the public to experience how neuroscientific tools like EEG can reveal the hidden processes of the mind. It also illustrated how art and science can merge to make abstract research accessible, engaging, and inspiring for audiences of all ages.</p>

        <div class="event-text">
          <p>In 2018, I was invited to the university radio program UniversCité on Radio Campus Besançon to share my PhD research with a broad public audience. During the interview, I explained how electroencephalography (EEG) can record brain activity and how machine learning helps decode complex signals linked to memory, emotions, and perception.</p>
          <p>A highlight of the conversation was the Rihanna project, where participants listened to familiar and unfamiliar songs interrupted by short silences. > “When you know the song, your brain keeps going and fills in the gap—almost like saying please don’t stop the music.” The study showed how familiarity and preference (“I love this song” vs. “I can’t stand it”) produce distinct patterns of brain activity, and how these insights could support early diagnostic tools for Alzheimer’s disease and depression.</p>
          <p>To make the concepts concrete, I used analogies: teaching a computer to classify brain activity is like teaching a child to tell apart cats and dogs—by giving many examples until the distinguishing features become clear. This illustrated how machine learning moves us from averaged group data to individualized analyses for each patient.</p>
          <p>The discussion also covered broader themes: how depression and stress physically reshape the brain, how EEG can reveal differences between concentration, wakefulness, and sleep, and how research with coma patients might help doctors refine prognosis and adapt care. The interview blended scientific depth with humor and practical relevance, making neuroscience accessible, engaging, and relatable to a wide student and public audience.</p>

        <div class="event-text">
          <p>In December 2017, I took part in the scientific communication contest organized by the Société de Biologie de Besançon. This event gathered researchers from across the life sciences—mainly cell biology, genetics, and microbiology—and offered a platform to present research in an accessible and engaging way.</p>
          <p>My presentation introduced an original approach to neuroscience within this context: using EEG signal processing and machine learning to detect residual consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness. While the local audience was more accustomed to molecular and cellular topics, my talk showcased how computational methods such as Support Vector Machines and genetic algorithms can extract meaningful neural patterns from noisy EEG data.</p>
          <p>The challenge was particularly stimulating, as it required me to translate abstract concepts like feature extraction and algorithmic optimization into language accessible to biologists outside of my field. The experience demonstrated how artificial intelligence can enrich medical diagnostics, offering new tools for detecting neuro-markers of consciousness and supporting clinicians in critical decisions.</p>

        <div class="event-text">
          <p>In May 2017, I took part in the Experimentarium Festival in Arles, alongside young researchers from across France and Québec. The event was particularly enriching because it pushed us to adapt our communication formats to very different audiences and contexts. Over two days, I presented my research in a variety of settings: to passersby at the famous Arles market, to visitors at the museum during the Night of Museums, and to several middle school classes.</p>
          <p>One memorable challenge involved explaining my work using three randomly chosen objects—a stuffed parrot, a music box, and a clothes hanger. This playful exercise forced me to practice flexibility, creativity, and quick pitching skills while making complex ideas accessible.</p>
          <p>Beyond public engagement, the festival also offered the chance to meet fellow early-career researchers working on a wide spectrum of topics, from adapting ancient Greek plays into contemporary language to improving the precision of atomic clocks for GPS technology. This exchange of ideas highlighted the richness of interdisciplinary science communication and the many ways research can connect with society.</p>

        <div class="event-text">
          <p>The following month, in April 2017, I was invited to present the same interactive workshop at the Botanical Garden of Besançon. Once again, the audience brought together both children and adults from diverse backgrounds. In this setting, surrounded by a space dedicated to discovery and learning, participants explored how the brain reacts to familiar versus unfamiliar music, and how machine learning can be trained to classify these brain responses. Repeating the workshop in different public venues reinforced my ability to adapt scientific communication to varied audiences and contexts while keeping it engaging and accessible.</p>

        <div class="event-text">
          <p>At the start of my PhD in 2016, I joined the Experimentarium program run by the University’s Science, Art and Culture department. This one-week training prepared doctoral students to communicate their research in clear, engaging ways. My project explored how machine learning can be used to classify brain activity recorded with EEG while people listen to familiar and unfamiliar music.</p>
          <p>To make this concept accessible to children, I designed an interactive session in a fifth-grade classroom. First, the pupils listened to different pieces of music and reflected on how their brains might process them. Then, as a game, they took on the role of a “machine learning model”: their task was to sort and separate the two kinds of brain activity, just as a computer would. The activity sparked lively discussions, showed them how research connects with everyday experiences, and gave me a lasting foundation in creative science communication.</p>
